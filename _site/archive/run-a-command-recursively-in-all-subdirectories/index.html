  <p>Suppose you wish to run a linux command in the current working directory, and in all of its subdirectories recursively. For example, I discovered that sometimes, running ‘make modules_install’ compresses all the modules as a .xz file in the various subdirectories. I read that the kernel does not care if a module is compressed, it can load the module in any case, but I did not know that at the time. I initially considered running “xz –decompress “ on every .xz file, but there are simply too many subsystem and driver directories, and it would extremely tedious. So I wrote a little script to do it:</p>

"""
* Script to run a system command recursively in every subdirectory 
* in a directory, including the current working directory
* Usage: run_cmd.py -[si] -c &lt;command-to-run&gt;
*
* Options:
*   -i 
*       Interactive mode. Prompts user to choose whether or not to 
*       run the command in a directory
*   -s
*       Skips the command for the working directory
*   -c
*       Command to be run
*
* Example: $python run_cmd.py -s -c &lt;command-to-run&gt;
* This will run 'ls -l &gt; contents.txt' in every subdirectory in the tree
* recursively, but will not run it in the working directory

<p>I tested it out on Ubuntu 20.04, and it seems to work. An addition that could be made is maybe the script can take a list of directory in which to run the command and run it in those only. I mightget around to doing this someday very soon.</p>
