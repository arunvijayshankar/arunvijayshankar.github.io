  <p>Here are two ways to determine the number of elements in the Power set of a finite set of objects. The set of all subsets of a set is called a power set, and the number of all the elements in a given set is called its order. Consider the following set <em>S = {a, b, c}</em>. The order of this set is 3, and its power set is <em>P(S) = {O, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, S}</em>. Notice that the power set contains all subsets of <em>S</em>, including <em>S</em>, and the empty set <em>O</em>. We can see that <em>P(S)</em> has 8 elements, so its order is 8. If you carried out a similar exercize for a set <em>S’ = {a, b, c, d}</em>, we will find that its order is 16. It looks like the order of a the power set of a set with <em>n</em> elements is <em>2</em><sup><em>n</em></sup>.</p>

<p>We can show that this is actually true. Let’s prove it in two ways. First let’s use mathematical induction, which is intuitive and clean, but a little dry IMO. Next, let’s show that it is true by just counting the elements (kind of). This is a lot more fun, and it’s nice to see how a couple of things come together to solve the problem.</p>

<p>But first let’s do induction. Notice that if a set <em>S</em> is empty, it has <em>n = 0</em> elements. The power set, <em>P(S)</em>, then only has one element - the empty set (which is also the entire set <em>S</em>). So the order of the power set is 1, and <em>2</em><sup><em>0</em></sup> = <em>1</em>, so the base case is true. Now let’s assume that it is true for the power set of a set with <em>n</em> elements. So the power set of a set with <em>n</em> elements would have order <em>2</em><sup><em>n</em></sup>. Let’s denote the elements of the power sets as <em>S</em><sub><em>1</em></sub>, <em>S</em><sub><em>2</em></sub>, …, <em>S</em><sub><em>m</em></sub>, where <em>m</em> = <em>2</em><sup><em>n</em></sup>. Now consider adding one more element to <em>S</em>, bringing the number of elements contained by it to <em>n+1</em>. Adding this additional element to <em>S</em> creates a whole bunch of new subsets, and we have to determine how many new subsets are created and add it to <em>2</em><sup><em>n</em></sup>, to find the order of the new power set of <em>S</em>. Notice that all the new subsets of <em>S</em> can be created by adding the new element to each of the subsets of <em>S</em> with <em>n</em> elements.</p>

<p>For example, if <em>S</em> = <em>{a, b}</em>, then <em>P(S)</em> = <em>{O, {a}, {b}, S}</em>. If we add a third element, <em>c</em>, to this set, then we get the new subsets -</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post14/new_sets.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Essentially, by adding an additional element to <em>S</em>, we are adding one additional subset to every subset in power set of the original set. So we have two times as many elements in the power set of a set with <em>n+1</em> elements, as in the power set of one with <em>n</em> elements. That is, the order of the power set of a set with <em>n+1</em> elements is <em>2</em> x <em>2</em><sup><em>n</em></sup> = <em>2</em><sup><em>n+1</em></sup>, and we are done.</p>

<p>Now let’s do it the fun way. Notice that we can determine the number of subsets of a set with <em>n</em> elements but counting the number of subsets with 0 elements (the empty set), the number of subsets with 1 element (these are called singletons, there are <em>n</em> of them), with 2 elements and so on, up to the number of subsets with <em>n</em> elements (there’s one such subset - the entire set), and then adding them all up. To do this, let’s find the number of subsets with <em>k</em> elements. This is equivalent to the number of ways of choosing <em>k</em> objects from a collection of <em>n</em> objects. We know that this is</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post14/nCk_new.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now we have to sum the number of subsets with <em>k</em> elements from <em>k</em> = <em>0</em> to <em>k</em> = <em>n</em>. That is, the order of the power set is</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post14/order.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>All that is left to do is evaluating the sum on the right hand side of the above equation. It looks a little intimidating, and trying to evaluate it by expanding the sum and adding all the terms will turn out to be quite an effort. So maybe there’s another way. Notice that the sum looks remarkably similar to the sum in the binomial theorem:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post14/binom_thm.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In fact if we set <em>x</em> = <em>y</em> = <em>1</em> in the binomial theorem, the sum will be the same as the sum in our expression for the order of the power set,</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post14/binom_mod.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post14/xplusy.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>which means</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post14/final.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>and we’re done!</p>

  <p>In <a href="https://arunvijayshankar.github.io/archive/powers-of-permutation-matrices-pt1/">Part 1</a>, we saw how every permutation has at least one cycle, and that the size of the cycle is the number of elements in the cycle. If we now consider a permutation that is one big cycle of all the elements in our set, then we can easily see that if we apply the same permutation <em>n</em> times, <em>n</em> being the number of elements in the set, all elements return to the positions with which they started out. So <em>p</em><sup><em>n</em></sup> = <em>e</em> for such a permutation, where once again, <em>e</em> is the identity.</p>

<p>But what about permutations that are not just one cycle of all elements? What if the permutation consists of a combinations of cycles of different cycles and/or fixed points (elements that remain fixed in their positions upon application of a permutation are called fixed points). To explore this further, let us consider a couple of specific examples.</p>

<ol>
	<li> The permutation is one in which two elements in the set switch places, the rest are fixed points - In this case, there is one cycle of size two, and the rest are fixed points, so they are all in cycles of size one. So if we apply the permutation for a second time, both elements that switched places return to their original position, and the rest will have remained in the same position with which they started out. So if <em>p</em> denotes this particular permutation, then <em>p</em><sup>2</sup> = 2 </li>
	<li>The permutation consists of two cycles of size <em>k<sub>1</sub></em> and <em>k<sub>2</sub></em> respectively - Here, we immediately see that the first cycle with return to its starting arrangement after <em>k<sub>1</sub></em> applications of the permutation and the second cycle will return to its starting arrangement after <em>k<sub>2</sub></em> applications. To calculate how many applications of the permutation are needed for both cycles to return to the starting configuration, notice that either cycle will return to the start when the permutation is applied <em>mk</em> times, where <em>m</em> is a positive integer. So this means that if the permutation is applied <em>k<sub>1</sub>k<sub>2</sub></em> times, both cycles will have returned to their original positions (notice that if <em>k<sub>2</sub></em> = <em>qk<sub>1</sub></em> then both cycles will return to the starting positions after just <em>k<sub>2</sub></em> applications of the permutation). That is, <em>p<sup>k<sub>1</sub>k<sub>2</sub></sup></em> = <em>e</em></li> 
</ol>

<p>Let’s stop here for now, and in Part 3 let’s explore permutations that are a little more complex, and finally try and nail down the answer for any generic permutation.</p>

  <p>I came across this problem while working through the MITOCW course on <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/pages/ax-b-and-the-four-subspaces/transposes-permutations-vector-spaces/">Linear Algebra</a>. The lectures are interesting in of themselves, but I got completely sidetracked when I started on this problem:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post12/strang_problem.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This got me wondering if, given a permutation matrix <em>P</em>, we’d always be able to find a <em>k</em>, such that <em>P</em><sup><em>k</em></sup> = <em>I</em>, where <em>I</em> is the identity matrix. Equivalently, I wondered if, given a permutation of <em>n</em> objects, one can always recover the initial arrangement by successfully performing the same permutation over and over again. That is, if there is always a <em>k</em>, such that <em>p</em><sup><em>k</em></sup> = <em>e</em> (where <em>e</em> is the identity, a permutation that leaves the arrangement of objects unchanged) for a given permutation <em>p</em>.</p>

<p>It turns out that the answer is that there is! Given any permutation of <em>n</em> objects, you can recover the original arrangement by performing the same permutation on the object a specific number of times. The minimum number of times the permutation is to be repeated for a given permutation, depends on the internal structure of the permutation.</p>

<p>To prove this, we have to first recognize that every permutation has atleast one cycle. A cycle is a permutation such that if you start with one element and track its position  as the permutation is repeatedly applied, it eventually returns to its original position. As an example consider this simple collection of four objects <em>( a, b, c, d )</em>. If we apply the following permutation: <em>a -&gt; b, b -&gt; c, c -&gt; d, and d -&gt; a</em> (call this permutation <em>p</em>), and track the position of <em>c</em>, we have <em>( d, a, b,</em> <strong>c</strong> <em>)</em>. Applying the permutation again, i.e., <em>p</em><sup><em>2</em></sup>, we get <em>(</em> <strong>c,</strong> <em>d, a, b )</em>. One more application (<em>p</em><sup><em>3</em></sup>) gets us to <em>( b,</em> <strong>c,</strong> <em>d, a )</em>, and finally <em>p</em><sup><em>4</em></sup> gives <em>( a, b,</em> <strong>c,</strong> <em>d )</em> and we see that <em>c</em>, as well as the other elements, has returned to its starting position.</p>

<p>So why is it true that a permutation will have atleast one cycle? To understand this, consider a permutation on <em>n</em> objects where a subset of the objects have changed positions. If no elements have changed position, then each element can thought of as being in a cycle of size 1. If more than one object has changed positions after the permutation has been applied, any one object in the subset will have moved to the position occupied by another object which will in turn have moved to a different position. For a finite subset of objects, this means that the position occupied by the initial object will now be occupied by a different object in the subset. If we suppose that this permutation does not have a cycle, it implies that the first object will never return to it’s orginal position no matter how many times the permutation is applied. This can only happen if the first object never reaches the position of the last object (which moves to the first position upon first application of the permutation). But this can only happen if the first object never reaches the position of the second-to-last object, as so on, until we are forced to conclude that the first object can never even reach the second position, implying that it did not move. This contradicts the statement that all objects in the subset changed positions. So the only way out is to admit that this the subset is in a cycle and that the size of the cycle is the number of elements in the subset.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://arunvijayshankar.github.io/archive/powers-of-permutation-matrices-pt2/">Part 2</a>, we will explore some specific permutations that are composed of simple cycles, and see what happens when the permuation is applied repeatedly to a set of objects.</p>
