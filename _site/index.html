  <p><em>TL;DR</em></p>

<p>If you have an active OpenVPN connection to a remote linux machine, and are finding that you cannot ssh to it, try setting up port forwarding on your router config page to forward traffic from the OpenVPN port to the ssh port on your box. Configure the device IP on the config page to point to the local ip address of the linux machine. Connect over ssh with: <em>ssh host@local_ip_address</em></p>

<p><em>/TL;DR</em></p>

<p>About two years ago I bought a cheap desktop computer and installed Linux (Ubuntu, because I’m a noob) on it. I decided that I wanted to learn software development, and I wanted to do it on Linux. Setup was not without issues, and I still haven’t managed to get wifi working on it, but overall it was easy. I thought I would use the box for learning and writing code only, but it has become my primary home PC. I’m using it right now in writing this. The PC serves me very well, but almost immediately after setting it up, I realized I wanted to ssh into it from a remote host. Mainly from my laptop for when I work from bed.</p>

<p>I looked up how to get ssh running on ubuntu and found lots of great guides on the topic. I configured the server, and added key based authentication for extra security. This was super easy and I was able to ssh into the linux box from my laptop. But because I am greedy, I wanted to be able to ssh into from outside my home network too. I looked up how to do that and when I saw that it meant I had to expose the ssh port to the internet at large, I was sufficiently put off to abandon the idea altogether. It also seemed to involve something called “port forwarding” which I don’t think I will ever truly understand. If anyone reading this post has any resources that explain port forwarding in a easy to understand fashion, I would appreciate it if you could send it my way.</p>

<p>Now that I am a little older, and with about the same amount of wisdom, I decided to take another stab at it. Having worked from home for the past two years, and having acquired a better understanding of what VPNs are and how they work, I wondered if I could set up a home VPN and connect to that remotely. If I could do that, then I could ssh into the linux box from anywhere. Easy-peasy. After a bit of reading, I learnt that you can setup a VPN using your home router. I checked mine and found that it could setup a VPN. Mine has a couple of options for VPNs, but I choose OpenVPN becuase I had heard of it and becuase it said “secure” in the description. I intend to look into PPTP and L2TP/IPSec (the other options) a little later. I configured OpenVPN by following the online guide published for TP-Link routers. Configuring it on your router might be a little different. Searching for <em>router_name VPN setup</em> should return setup guides for your router, if you wish to set one up. I also downloaded and installed the OpenVPN client on my laptop. I configured the client with the OpenVPN config file I generated on the Linux box (which is now the OpenVPN server).</p>

<p>With all of this setup, I connected my laptop to a mobile hotspot using my phone to simulate an external network and tried to connect to the VPN. After a little bit of fiddling around with the server settings, I could connect to it. I tried pinging the server, and once I confirmed that it was working, I tried to connect over ssh. Which did not work. Server was rejecting my connections. So I went back to the internet. I found that while this is not a very common issue, it has been faced by quite a few people. The common diagnosis was that all traffic gets tunneled over the VPN, and we have to let the server know to deal with SSH traffic separately. Most fixes I read involved changing the ip table rules to do… something. I can’t say I understood what that was all about. Still, in true sw engineer fashion, I tried out the commands to edit the ip table. This did not work either, as the syntax for editing the ip table has either changed, or is different for ubuntu for some reason.</p>

<p>I did find one post that specified allowing ssh over the OpenVPN port (which was configured when I set OpenVPN up) through the firewall. That seemed promising, so I tried it out. Still no luck. The server kept rejecting my ssh connections. I was about to give up once again, when I remembered one particular comment in one of the posts which suggested setting up NAT forwarding. I was still reluctant to try changing anything here, since, as mentioned earlier, I don’t really understand what port forwarding is. However, since I was grasping at straws at this point, I thought I’d give it a shot. And there it was, in the NAT forwarding tab in my router config page: “Port Forwarding”. The config page asked me to specify a device IP address, an internal port, and an external port. At first I tried the ssh port for both internal and external ports, which did not work at all. Then I realised that the external port was the port to which traffic was being sent, and the internal port was the port to which traffic was to be forwarded. The device IP address was to be set to the IP address of the device to which the traffic was to be forwarded. This became clear once I realized that when I connect to a VPN, I am essentially making a connection to my router, and not necessarily to any device on my home network. With port forwarding configured and enabled, I was able to ssh to my linux box from my laptop! I headed over to a cafe to try it out from an actual public networked and it worked there as well.</p>

<p>It seems a little unbelievable that I have finally managed to solve something that I have been unsuccessful at on so many attempts in the past two years. I guess the lesson is, if a problem is being difficult, set it aside and try again at a different time. You might have learned something that turns to be the key to solving it.</p>

<p><em>PS</em></p>

<p>An interesting aside: I can ssh over the VPN if I use the IP address on my home subnet, but not when I use the IP address provided to the box by OpenVPN. I’m guessing that this is because I provided the home subnet IP address when I configured port forwarding on the router. But if I try and configure the OpenVPN IP address for port forwarding, the router rejects it, saying that it should have the same netmask as the router. Not sure if I can get around this. If anyone knows any way to ssh over OpenVPN with the IP address assigned by OpenVPN, please let me know!</p>

  <p>One good thing about Twitter<sup>TM</sup> is that once in a while I come across a tweet that voices out load the exact thing I was looking for. In this instance, I found this <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1505597582227165194">tweet</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk">@b0rk</a>, looking for networking courses. There were a lot of good suggestions, but this one caught my eye: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqbS7AVVErFivDY3iKAQk3_VAm8SXwt1X">Implementing TCP</a>, by <a href="https://twitter.com/jonhoo">@jonhoo</a>. It is an implementation of TCP using Rust. It drew my eye immediately as learning Rust has been on my mind for a while now. Now, I do not know the first thing about Rust, and not very much more about networking, but I have found that I learn best by doing, so I drove right into it. Jon mentions RFC 1180 as a good tutorial to TCP/IP which I started reading  in parallel to the video series. I’m about 45 minutes into Part 1, and there are already a bunch of concepts with which I am completely unfamiliar. Nevertheless, just by following along, I was able to write a “virtual” NIC in rust. The only thing it does is read an IP packet as a bunch of bytes. Still, pretty cool. It wasn’t without hicups though. The setcap command did not work until I provided the entire path to the compiled binary, and for some reason $CARGO_TARGET_DIR, which I assumed was set during the setup, was not really set to anything. But barring these minor setbacks, the code compiled and ran pretty well.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post3/ip_packet_rcvd_1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The first new rust concept i hit upon in the video was cargo. Cargo is the build and packaging system of Rust. I learned that it downloads the necessary libraries and builds your code. You list your projects dependencies (packages of code, called Crates) in the .toml file, and Cargo will download and link them for you. You can use cargo to build your code using “cargo build –release” and it will build and create your binaries in a separate folder. There are a bunch of options you can specify in the build command like ‘r’ to build your code, and then run it, or ‘b’ to only compile your code and build the binary.</p>

<p>The tutorial introduced TUN/TAP next. This is a really cool kernel module that provides packet transmission and reception for User space programs. If I understand correctly, it creates a virtual network adapter to whom the kernel forwards packets from a user space program, and whose packets the kernel sends to the user space program. There is already a Rust crate for Tun/Tap bindings which is used in the tutorial. It’s a really cool module, and I’m sure I’ll be using it a lot in my networking adventures in the future. The actual syntax is very similar to C and Jon quickly covered the actual code by following the tun_tap docs closely.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
use std::io;

fn main() -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt; {
	let nic = tun_tap::Iface::new("tun0", tun_tap::Mode::Tun)?;
	let mut buf = [0u8; 1504];
	let nbytes = nic.recv(&amp;mut buf[..])?;
	eprintln!("read {} bytes: {:x?}", nbytes, &amp;buf[..nbytes]);
	Ok(())
}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A new thing in Rust is the syntax to use library functions. For example, to user a function called “some_function()” that is part of “some_library”, you would write: some_library::some_function(). A few other new things are “match”, OK(), Err(), and the “-&gt;” and “=&gt;” operators, but I will dive deeper into them as I move forward.</p>

<p>To use TUN/TAP, we need CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges which is confirgured with the setcap command: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo setcap cap_net_admin=eip &lt;path_to_target&gt;</code>. The tutorial uses $CARGO_TARGET_DIR in the path, but for some reason this did not work for me. I am not really sure if I have to set this variable myself, or if it gets set by cargo. In any case I was able to get around this by simply providing the relative path to the target. Finally, we compiled the code and ran it. Now when you run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ip addr</code>, you can see tun0 show up in your list of network devices.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post3/tun0_offline.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As of now, tun0 is not really doing anything. To configure it to listen for IP packets we have to run the following commands:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
sudo ip addr add &lt;some IP address&gt; dev tun0

sudo ip link set up dev tun0

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"ip addr add &lt;static IP address&gt; dev &lt;device name&gt;"</code> adds an ip address to the newly created network device tun0, and once that’s done, we bring tun0 online with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"ip link set up dev &lt;device name&gt;"</code>. tun0 will now listen for IP packets and the code will display the bytes in the packet that tun0 received.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post3/tun0_online.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To simplify the whole process, all the individual commands were wrapped up in a shell file:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
&lt;#!/bin/bash
cargo b --release
sudo setcap cap_net_admin=eip &lt;path to binary&gt;
&lt;path to binary&gt; &amp;
pid=$!
sudo ip addr add 192.168.0.1/24 dev tun0
sudo ip link set up dev tun0
trap "kill $pid" INT TERM
wait $pid

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and anytime we want trust to listen for IP packets sent to tun0, we can run the .sh file to compile any changes to the code, set cap_net_admin, run the program, and bring tun0 online.</p>

<p>So now we can bring tun0 online and listen for packets, but the program will stop running once tun0 receives an IP packet. To keep tun0 listening indefinitely, we put it in a loop. Loop is a rust functionality that let’s you run an infinite loop. Just put your code in a block like so</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
loop {

	# code goes here

}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we can ping the IP address we set earlier, and the component bytes will be displayed consecutively. However, these bytes are not really readable to most of us, I would imagine. To make better sense of the data, a rust crate called etherparse can be used to parse the hex data and extract useful information from them. We choose to pull source IP, destination IP, payload length, and IP protocol.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
match etherparse::Ipv4HeaderSlice::from_slice(&amp;buf[4..nbytes]) {
	Ok(p) =&gt; {
		let src = p.source_addr();
		let dst = p.destination_addr();
		let protocol = p.protocol();
		eprintln!(
			"{} -&gt; {} {}b of protocol {}",
			src,
			dst,
			p.payload_len(),
			protocol
		);
	},
	Err(e) =&gt; {
		eprintln!("ignoring weird packet {:?}", e);
	}
}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When we run the wrapper, we see a nicely formatted, more informational strings:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post3/formatted_packets_ping.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We can see that packets were sent to 192.168.0.2 from 192.168.0.1 with IP protocol 1, which is ICMP which is what ping uses. We can also use netcap to try and connect to the IP address (at any port) to see if it is reflected correctly:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post3/formatted_packet_tcp.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We can see that 40 bytes are received of protocol 6, which is TCP.</p>

<p>This brings us to the end of the first 45 minutes of the tutorial. I will cover the rest of the tutorial in roughly one hour chunks, I think. Along with actually coding and ironing out issues, it takes me around an hour or so to get through 45 minutes of video, so it seems like a good duration. The tutorial is 13 hours in total, and I expect to complete it in a month or so. Ideally, I would like to finish it a lot sooner, but needs must, so 45 minutes at a time it will have to be.</p>

  <p>I came across an interesting problem recently. I was running a python script that would periodically update a remote database. It would connect to the database with a shared login credential and update a table. The script would run locally on multiple machines. Initially, the hashed db password was stored in the script, and extracted before being used to connect to the database.</p>

<p>It was not too long before I realized that anyone with access to the script can straight up read the password without so much as a how do you do. I looked up password protection on the internet, and there are some good approaches out there, like using hashing with hashlib, storing the password in env values, or using Keyring to store and fetch the password. You can find a good tutorial on using them <a href="https://martinheinz.dev/blog/59">here</a></p>

<p>However, these approaches face the same issue. Anyone with access to the machine the script is running on, can recover the password quite easily. I think only some form of secure handshake/authentication protocol can provide user authentication without storing the password in the script. The problem is, I do not know the first thing about setting up such a system. Especially with a DBMS with which I am unfamiliar. Also, I’m pretty sure the shared login is pretty much an immutable object (pun intended), and I cannot avoid using it. So I thought about it some more, and it occurred to me, that the only reason to keep the password in the script in the first place was because it used a connect_to_db module in the same script to connect to the database.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/db_conn_mod.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I realized that if I moved the entire connection module to a different file, and imported that file as a library in my script, my script would still have the db connection, but would not need the password in the script in any form. I could then use Keyring in the special connection library to retrieve a password that I store on the system separately, again using Keyring. But this just moves the problem to a different python file. To ensure that the password cannot be extracted from the connection lib file either, I hit upon the idea of compiling the lib file, and including only the byte file along with the main script. And that did it! The script works, and has at least somewhat better security than earlier.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/conn.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now, this is still not very secure. It is very easy to de-compile the pyc file and extract the password from it. Still, some security is better than no security.</p>
