I’m a software engineer in the semiconductor and communications industry. I’m primarily interested programming, languages, and mathematics. I also dabble in amateur radio, astronomy, and archery. My amateur radio callsign is K6ARV.

Arktos kai Mennos: Arktos is ancient Greek for bear, Mennos is Aeolic Greek for the Moon. I like bears, and I have mixed feelings about the Moon.
