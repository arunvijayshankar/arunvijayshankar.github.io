<p>A couple of weeks ago, I came across this equation for a two channel multiplexer in a book on x86 Assembly</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Z = ( Y &amp; S ) | ( X &amp; ~S )
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I was a little surprised at how simple the equation was and, out of curiosity, I drew a quick schematic of it</p>

<p>It occured to me that I could build this for a simple and fun project. I had never really built any circuits before, and this seemed like a good first attempt. So I ordered the logic gates, and put it together once they were delivered, a few days later. Itâ€™s a very simple circuit and it was really easy to build.</p>

<p>I used my beaglebone board to power the circuit, and for the input data streams for the two channels on the multiplexer. For the inputs I chose two pwm signals of 2Hz and 5Hz respectively and forwarded them from GPIO header pins on the beaglebone black. I kept the pwm signal frequency low to make the channel selection easier to observe. The circuit uses a push-button to flip the selection channel to choose between the two input channels. Here is a small demo of the circuit in action.</p>
